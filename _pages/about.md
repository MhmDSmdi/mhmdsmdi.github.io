My name is Mohammadreza, and I am an M.Sc. student at the Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, advised by [Davood Rafiei](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/). I am highly interested in natural language processing and information retrieval, and currently, I am working on query performance prediction in multi-hop QA. Before starting my M.Sc. studies, I did my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en) where I worked on implementing a fake news detection system as a fact-checker for Persian news under the supervision of [Saeede Momtazi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2345/Saeede%20Momtazi).
For further information, please see the latest version of my [**CV**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13CM4jmm1uN8ygHMu0t3ZgmhNzujJkRIn/view?usp=sharing).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
