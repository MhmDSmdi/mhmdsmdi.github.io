My name is Ehsan (pronounced /eh☀️/ or /ih☀️/, or even /e☀️/).
I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, advised by [Davood Rafiei](https://cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/).
I am broadly interested in the intersection of natural language processing and information retrieval.
My goal is to facilitate information access over massive unstructured materials via:
- Building scalable and robust retrieval systems that are suitable for deployment "in the wild",
- Data-centric strategies to systematically improve data quality and to overcome bias in data.

During my PhD, I was fortunate enough to collaborate with [Charles Clarke](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~claclark/).
I also interned as a researcher at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in Montreal and worked with [Mehdi Rezagholizadeh](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-rezagholizadeh-61212346), [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/), [Peyman Passban](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/passban), and [Ali Ghodsi](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/ali-ghodsi).
Prior to PhD, I was working as a software engineer.
