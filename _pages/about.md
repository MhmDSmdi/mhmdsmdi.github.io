My name is Mohammadreza, and I am an AI Researcher at Huawei Canada, specializing in optimizing Generative AI models—such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models—for efficient deployment. Passionate about making AI accessible and efficient, I focus on developing advanced technologies that are lightweight and fast for real-world applications. Before joining Huawei, I worked as a Machine Learning intern at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), where I created customized AI solutions to meet the unique needs of various companies.

I hold an M.Sc. in Computing Science from the University of Alberta, where I was advised by [Prof. Davood Rafiei](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/). My research focused on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, particularly on query performance prediction in multi-hop question answering. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), where I developed a fake news detection system for Persian news under the guidance of [Prof. Saeede Momtazi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2345/Saeede%20Momtazi).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
